🔍 Project Steps
1. Load Data in Python

Imported dataset using Pandas

Checked structure, data types, and initial statistics

Identified missing values, duplicates, and outliers

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps

Trend analysis and pattern discovery

Key findings documented in the notebook

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Removed duplicates

Fixed invalid data types

Created new calculated fields where needed

Saved the cleaned dataset for SQL loading

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL

Created tables and inserted data

Ran SQL queries for aggregations, segmentation, customer behavior analysis, etc.

Used GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, JOIN, window functions (where applicable)

5. Power BI Dashboard Development

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL dataset

Designed an interactive dashboard featuring:

KPIs

Donut/Bar charts

Trend lines

Filters and slicers

Focused on usability, clarity, and storytelling

6. Final Report

Summarized insights and recommendations

Highlighted business implications

Added visual explanations and interpretations

Delivered in PDF/Word format (optional)

7. Presentation (Gamma)

Created a clean, visually appealing deck

Explained methodology, insights, and dashboard walkthrough

Designed for recruiters and stakeholders
